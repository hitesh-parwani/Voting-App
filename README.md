# Voting App

This is a web-based application for managing and conducting voting processes. The project uses Apache Tomcat as the server, Oracle as the database, and incorporates Servlets and JDBC for its operations.

## Requirements

1. **Apache Tomcat**
   - Version: 9.0 or later
   - [Download Apache Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)

2. **Oracle Database**
   - Version: 12c or later
   - Ensure that the Oracle Database is up and running and that you have the necessary credentials to connect.

3. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**
   - Version: 8 or later
   - [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

4. **JDBC Driver for Oracle**
   - Ensure that the Oracle JDBC driver (ojdbc8.jar) is included in your project's classpath.

## Project Structure

The Voting App project is structured as follows:

- `src/main/java`: This directory contains the Java source code for Servlets and other backend logic of the application.
- `src/main/webapp`: This directory contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend user interface.
- `src/main/resources`: This directory typically contains configuration files such as `db.properties` for database connection details.

The project structure is organized to separate backend and frontend code, following standard practices in web application development.
